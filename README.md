# top10-kpi-tool
Tool to quickly identify the top N worst performing items by a weighted set of given kpi metrics with time decay importance.  Its just an xl sheet that lets you setup the weights and metrics and the vba macro does the processing of an exported csv stats file.

This is a super useful tool for keeping ontop of performance management of a complex system, you do not need million dollar kpi management tools, you just need to code your own.  

I would just re-write this tool in python or some other scripting language when I have time.
